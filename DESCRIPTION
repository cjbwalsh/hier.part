Title: Hierarchical Partitioning
Description: Partitioning of the independent and joint contributions of each
    variable in a multivariate data set, to a linear regression by hierarchical
    decomposition of goodness-of-fit measures of regressions using all 
    combinations of variables in the data set. (i.e., model (1), (2), ..., (N),
		(1,2), ..., (1,N), ..., (1,2,3,...,N)).   A randomization test permits
    the quantification of relative ‘effect sizes’ associated with the 
    partitioning.
