\title{
  All Combinations of a Hierarchy of Models of n Variables
}
\description{
  Lists a matrix of combinations of 1 to n variables in ascending order
}
\usage{
  combos(n)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{
    an integer: the number of variables
  }
  }

\details{
Lists hierarchy of all possible combinations of n variables in ascending
order, starting with 1 variable, then all combinations of 2 variables,
and so on until the one combination with all n variables.  This function
is used by \code{all.regs} to structure the models required for
hierarchical partioning.  This function requires the gtools package in
the gregmisc bundle.
}

\value{
  a list containing
  \item{ragged}{
    a matrix with zeroes in empty elements and 1 in column 1, 2 in
    column 2 ... n in column n for full elements
  }

  \item{binary}{
    a matrix as for ragged, but with 1 in all full elements
    }
