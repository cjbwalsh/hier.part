NAME		hierpart - variance partition of multivariate data set
SYNOPSIS	
DESCRIPTION	`Hierpart' is an implementation of the hierarchical
		partitioning algorithm published by Chevan and
		Sutherland (1991: The American Statistician 45: 90).
		The approach uses the entire hierarchy of models based
		on N variables to apportion amounts of individual
		and joint explanation between the variables. Input
		data are the measures of goodness of fit for models
		in ascending order (i.e., model (1), (2), ..., (N),
		(1,2), ..., (1,N), ..., (1,2,3,...,N)). In general
		linear modelling (especially regression), the 0-order
		model is associated with 0.0 (i.e., no correlation
		or explained sums of squares). However, in log-linear
		modelling, the chi-square statistic is the appropriate
		measure, and it is the largest of all model goodness
		of fit values. Thus, `hierpart' allows command line
		input to specify the 0-order value if necessary
		(otherwise 0).~
		~
		The output is a simple table consisting of the variable
		number, its independent contribution (I) and its
		conjoint contribution with all other variables (J).

NOTES		This implementation of hierpart was updated 
                by Chris Walsh and Ralph Mac Nally with advice
		from Aleck Mac Nally in February 2020 for
                the hier.part package in R
